# SLP(Single Layer Perceptron)

- If ANN model has no hidden layer, it is called single layer perceptron.
- In contrast, MLP(Multiple Layer Perceptron) model is ANN which has multiple hidden layers (more than 1)

## Perceptron Recap
In the perceptron model inputs can be real numbers unlike the Boolean inputs in MP Neuron Model. The output from the model will still be binary {0, 1}. The perceptron model takes the input x if the weighted sum of the inputs is greater than threshold b output will be 1 else output will be 0.<br>
